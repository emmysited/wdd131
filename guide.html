    <h1>Tomato Farming Guide</h1>

    <section>
      <h2>1. Selecting the Right Variety</h2>
      <p>Choose tomato varieties suited for your region's climate. Some common types include Money Maker, Roma VF, and Marglobe.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>2. Land Preparation</h2>
      <p>Clear the land of weeds, plough deeply, and apply organic manure. Create raised beds or ridges to improve drainage.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>3.. Soil and Water</h2>
      <p>Tomato plants grow best when they have well-draining soil and 
        consistent moisture. If it rains less than an inch per 
        week, supplement by watering. In sprinkler terms, 
        that's 20 minutes three times a week. 
        If you notice the plants starting to wilt,
        you may need to water more frequently 
        in very hot weather. To prevent diseases, 
        avoid wetting the foliage. Use a watering can or
         wand to deliver water directly to the root zones, 
         or use a drip irrigation system.
         Placing mulch around your tomato plants discourages weeds, maintains soil moisture, and prevents diseases from splashing off the soil onto the leaves when it rains.</p>

      <h2>3. Planting</h2>
      <p>Sow seeds in a nursery. Transplant healthy seedlings after 4–6 weeks when they are about 15cm tall, spacing them 60cm apart.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>4. Watering and Fertilization</h2>
      <p>Water regularly especially during dry spells. Apply NPK fertilizers at the base and mulch to retain moisture.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>5. Pest and Disease Management</h2>
      <p>Gardeners aren't the only creatures that like the way tomatoes taste. The plants attract a host of unwanted visitors, ranging from the aptly named tomato hornworm to the ever-present aphid menace and everything in between. The best advice is to remain vigilant. Watch for the beginning of any damage to your plants, identify the cause, and use safe management techniques as soon as possible.

In the case of hornworms, just pick them off (yuck!). Treat aphids, white flies, and spider mites with insecticidal soap or neem oil, following the product directions.

Other problems with tomato plants include blossom end rot, which occurs when the soil pH level is too low, and blossom drop, which results from nighttime temperatures that fall below the plant's preferred nighttime range of 55°F to 75°F.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>6. Harvesting</h2>
      <p>Tomatoes are prime for plucking when they're fully colored and firm. Weather plays a role in the timeline; tomatoes ripen best at temperatures close to 75°F. When the temperature rises to about 90°F, the fruits soften and develop poor color. If you pick green tomatoes at mature size, they will ripen indoors.

        Before a hard frost, harvest all but the greenest fruits and bring them indoors. Use them in a recipe or allow the green fruits to ripen in a closed paper bag. Check the fruits once a week for ripeness, removing any rotten tomatoes or those not showing signs of ripening. You can also uproot whole plants and hang them in a warm, sheltered spot where the fruits can continue to ripen.
        Ripe tomatoes can be stored on your kitchen counter for up to a week, depending on the room's temperature. You can put tomatoes in the refrigerator, but they won't taste as incredible as those stored at room temperature.</p>
